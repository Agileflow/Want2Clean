» How do you vet the cleaners?

We first carry out a telephone interview. If the applicant seems suitable we then arrange for a more thorough interview to take place in their own home. Only after taking proof of ID and address along with references do we accept them onto our database. We then monitor every cleaner thoroughly for the whole time they are with us.



» Do I meet my cleaner before the first clean?

Of course! We know the cleaner will be in your home and that personalities are often as important as cleaning standards. Once we choose a cleaner for you, we'll arrange for them to come along and meet you so that you can approve our choice and discuss the cleaning tasks you require. It's important that your cleaner is someone you like so there's no need to agree to the first person we send you. Once you're satisfied that we've sent the right person for you, you can then mutually arrange a regular clean day and time.



» What if my cleaner can't make it, or is sick?

Just give us a call and we will provide you with a cleaner to cover.



» Will I have to be at home when my cleaner cleans?

No, our cleaners are vetted and are happy to hold your house keys. We will provide you with a Key Acknowledgement Form for your cleaner to sign.



» Do I have to supply cleaning materials?

Yes, our cleaners do not carry their own materials as the majority of our clients prefer to specify the substances used in their homes. Please be aware that due to health and safety bleach is a banned substance.



» Can I change my cleaner if I am not happy?

Yes, of course, we have a large and varied cleaner base and we'd be happy to assign you someone different if you are unhappy for any reason. Just give us a call.



» Do you have insurance cover?

Yes, including a minimum of £1,000,000 public liability insurance. In line with all other insurance policies, there is an excess on the policy. In order to keep costs reasonable the excess is £100 per claim.



On this page we've tried to provide some helpful tips for tackling those difficult stains and awkward cleaning jobs. If you have any tips not covered here that you'd like to share please send them to us, our email address is at the bottom of this page.

Blocked Sinks

Blocked sinks can be a real problem and it's always better to prevent the problem rather than have to fix it later! To prevent your sink from becoming blocked put a few tea spoons of salt down it every couple of weeks followed by boiling water straight from the kettle. The combination of salt and boiling water helps to unblock and clean the pipes.

If you're going on holiday, try pouring some baking soda down your drains and plug holes before you go away to keep them smelling fresh for your return.

See more tips here: www.diynot.com/pages/pl/pl005.php

Baking Soda

This is a very versatile cleaning product and completely harmless to most surfaces. Use a damp cloth sprinkled with baking soda to get rid of heavy dirt and grime. The baking soda will cut straight through the grease.

See more tips here: www.bakingsodabook.co.uk

Glass Cleaning

Common ways of cleaning glass effectively are using glass cleaners and chamois leathers. Apply the glass cleaner with a cloth and buff up with another dry cloth.

See more tips here: www.great-glass.co.uk

Removing Stickers

Removing stickers is often a problem on most surfaces, leaving behind a sticky, dust-collecting residue. Nail varnish remover is very effective at removing these stubborn marks.

For other sticky materials such as chewing gum on carpets, don't try to pull it off. Freeze it by placing ice cubes on it and, once frozen, it will break off easily.

See more tips here: www.ehow.com/remove-stickers/

Red Wine Stains

Spilt red wine is perhaps the most notorious of stains -- not just the sight of it, but also the pungent smell. Using common salt can help to remove these stains by soaking up the colour. Sprinkle a little salt over the stained area and leave to absorb the colour. Then simply brush the salt off the area and use biological detergent to remove the remaining stain.

See more tips here: www.stainexpert.co.uk

Oven Cleaning

Purchase a general oven cleaner from your supermarket and apply to your whole oven, after removing all rods and trays. Use a sponge and scourer to remove any stubborn build-ups and rinse with clean hot water.

See more tips here: www.hintsandthings.co.uk

Blinds

The most thorough way of cleaning mini-blinds is to take them off of the window and wash them in the bathtub using a mild detergent, warm water and a sponge. Rinse thoroughly and allow to dry.

See more tips here: www.hgtv.com/organizing/how-to-clean-blinds/index.html

Leather Furniture

Cleaning leather is a lot different from common sofa materials. Instead of using a vacuum on the sofas it is best to use a damp clean cloth to remove dust.
